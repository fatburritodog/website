I like the caged feeling it brings to the type but it was a little too much. Messing with the color brought about different atmospheres, which is always fun to explore when working!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/4/attwn_r_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"576\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/4/attwn_g_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"432\" height=\"576\"></p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p><em>Branding, Concept, Photography</em></p>\n<p>A film festival that features the works of David Fincer and Steve McQueen. I was very interested in the films that these directors make because they are quite dark and twisted. The films are very complex and deal with very heavy topics. Characters in their films also have very intricate and delicate relationships with one another. While watching their films, I felt that loss was one of the main reoccuring themes of their works. </p>\n<p><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/2/loggie_bigger.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1260\"></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">The main motif: a moth</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/2/green_ticket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"247\"></p>\n<p><img class=\"align-center\" src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/2/pink_ticket.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"433\" height=\"272\"></p>\n<p class=\"align-center\">Ticket stubs for the festival</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/2/Flag-Mockup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4500\" height=\"3000\"></p>\n<p>Eye catching banners</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://kellyhaeseker.com/media/posts/2/Flag-Mockup_crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"1022\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cq0LXVCMAHvInqXut1naO3OOKemQa0GQ/view?usp=sharing\" title=\"Link!\">Feel free to view the process PDF for some indepth commentary.</a></p>",
